# Flask Notes

## Views and URLs
a view is generated by a *view function*. A view function can take arguments. The name of the view is, by default, the same as the view function.

A view can also be called an *endpoint*.

To get the URL to a view, we can use the `url_for()` function (a method from the flask package). `url_for` takes as a minimum(?) the name of the view as an argument. Other arguments include (or are) the arguments taken by the view function.

For example, if we had a view function `hello(name:str)`, we could get the url to the view generated by `hello("Alex")` with `url_for("hello", "Alex")`

## Blueprint

A `Blueprint` is a class that from the flask package. It acts as a collection of views and "other code".

Once a Blueprint exists, say `bp = Blueprint()`, we 
- register a view to that Blueprint via decoration. 
- register the Blueprint with the app inside the app factory

```python 
# flaskr/auth.py
from flask import Blueprint 
bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')

@bp.route('/login', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
def login():
    ...
```

The endpoint of the login view becomes 'auth.login', from the name of the Blueprint being prepended to the name of the view.
